				<ol class="help-type">
					<li>Select the job title from the “Current Jobs” section of your dashboard.</li>
					<li>Go to the “SafePay” section of the workroom.</li>
					<li>Click “Issue a Refund”.</li>
					<li>Select the amount you want to return.</li>
					<li>Click “Issue Refund”.</li>
				</ol>
