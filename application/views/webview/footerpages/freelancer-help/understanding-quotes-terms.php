<p>The terms you send in your quote tell our system how to bill your employer. It also sets the scope and establishes timelines. It’s the key to beginning a job successfully.</p>

<p><u>Choosing the type of quote:</u></p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tr>
		<td>Fixed-Priced Agreement (completed milestones)</td>
		<td>Hourly Agreement (weekly time tracked)</td>
		<td>Placeholder (estimate quote)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>You set up milestones. Each milestone has a value and a due date. You bill for a milestone once it’s finished.</td>
		<td>You set up max hours per week, an hourly rate and a billing end date. The system sends the employer an invoice every Monday based on the time you have tracked the prior week.</td>
		<td>You’re not yet sure what the entire scope is and wish to add a placeholder quote until you get more details.</td>
