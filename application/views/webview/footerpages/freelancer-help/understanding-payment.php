			<p>You and your employer have two transaction options in our mandatory billing & payment system—paying invoices alone and paying invoices via SafePay. SafePay provides more payment protection than invoicing alone.</p>

			<p><b>Working with an employer you already know?</b> <a href="sending-invoices">Invoicing</a> allows you to accumulate customer and earnings statistics. It also protects your financial and tax ID information. It’s fast and easy — you receive funds immediately after employers make payment. However, we <i>cannot assist</i> you with <i>unpaid invoices.</i></p>

			<p><b>Working with a new employer?</b> SafePay has all the benefits of invoicing and offers the most payment protection! Up-front SafePay payments and dispute resolution services help you avoid unpaid invoices. You have a choice of transfer methods with which to receive your cash account funds: direct deposit, PayPal, Prepaid MasterCard, and wire transfer.</p>
