			<p>Look for the blue check mark next to your employer’s name to confirm that they have a verified payment method. Working with an employer who has a verified payment method benefits you in two big ways:</p>

			<p>Payment Assurance: You can tell the employer intends to pay for the work you do.</p>

			<p>Automatic SafePay Funding & Payment: As soon as an agreement-based invoice is created we automatically charge the employer’s verified payment method. This will make sure there are enough funds in SafePay to be paid to you at the agreed upon time.</p>
			
			<p>Bank accounts, PayPal accounts and credit cards can all be verified.</p>
