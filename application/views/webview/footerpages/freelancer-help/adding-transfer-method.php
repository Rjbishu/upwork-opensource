			<p><b>Payoneer Prepaid MasterCard</b></p>

			<p>There are no fees when transferring money from your cash account using Payoneer.</p>

			<p>When you add a Payoneer account under transfer methods, you will be taken to the Payoneer website where you will be prompted to either create a new account, or login using an existing account. You will follow the instructions on their site, and Payoneer will take it from there.</p>

			<p>It takes up to two business days for Payoneer to confirm your account for use with Winjobs.com. Once confirmed, you will be able to use your Prepaid MasterCard anywhere a debit MasterCard is accepted, including automatic teller machines (ATMs).</p>

			<p>You will receive an email notification from Payoneer when your application is confirmed or declined.</p>

			<p>For new, approved Prepaid MasterCard accounts, it can take up to 10 business days (U.S.) and 25 business days or more (International) to receive your Prepaid MasterCard.</p>

			<p>We offer a Prepaid MasterCard in partnership with Payoneer. If you have general questions or would like to know why your application was declined, please visit Payoneer.com or contact them directly by phone or email.</p>

			<p>Phone: 1.800.251.2521 (within U.S.) or 1.847.461.1386 (outside U.S.)</p>

			<p><b>Wire Transfer (Non-U.S. Bank Accounts Only)</b></p>

			<p>Wire transfer is only available to freelancers with non-U.S. bank accounts. There is a $9.00 wire transfer fee for every wire transfer sent.</p>

			<p>To transfer funds from your Winjobs.com cash account to your non-U.S. bank account via wire transfer, you must first register your bank account information on Winjobs.com.</p>

			<p>There is nothing you need to do to confirm your wire transfer account. We will upload your information to our bank to confirm that they have all the information they need to send funds to your bank. Once our bank gives us the thumbs up, we will mark your wire transfer account as confirmed.</p>

			<p>Confirmation should occur within one business day (Monday through Friday) of registration.</p>

			<p><u>W9 Requirement:</u></p>

			<p>The W-9 form is used by U.S. based Freelancers to report their tax identification numbers to their Employers for tax purposes.</p>

			<p>The 1099-Miscellaneous Income Form (1099-MISC) is the tax form sent to U.S. based independent contractors who have earned more than $600 the previous year.  It is the freelance equivalent of the W-2 form, which is sent to employees. To generate a 1099 form, independent contractors must complete and submit a W-9 tax form to the issuing agency.</p>

			<p>1099 forms contain the following information:</p>

			<p>
				<ol class="help-list">
					<li>Freelancer’s name and address</li>
					<li>Freelancer’s social security or tax ID number</li>
					<li>Payer’s name, address and telephone number</li>
					<li>Payer’s federal ID number (EIN)</li>
					<li>Amount of non-employee compensation</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>To receive a 1099 for the previous year you must:</p>

			<p>
				<ol class="help-list">
					<li>Reside in the U.S.</li>
					<li>Have received payments through Winjobs.com totaling $600 or more</li>
