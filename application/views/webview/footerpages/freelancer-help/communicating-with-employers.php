			<p>Once you've been hired, the system will create a workroom for your job. This will be the place for you to communicate with your employer.</p>

			<p><u>Communicating with an employer and your team:</u></p>

			<p>You can communicate via the “Discussions” page. This communication is shared among teammates that were also hired for this job.</p>

			<p>
				<ol class="help-list">
					<li>Navigate to a job you've been hired for.</li>
					<li>Click the “Discussions” tab.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p><u>Starting a new topic within the “Discussions” page:</u></p>

			<p><u>Communicating privately with an employer:</u></p>

			<p>You can communicate privately with employers using private messaging. Messages will be listed at the bottom of each job's workroom or from the “Messages” tab.</p>

			<p><u>Sending a sales message:</u></p>

			<p>Whether you are eligible to initiate a conversation using the messages tool depends on two factors.</p>

			<p><b>Membership level</b></p>

			<p>After applying for a job, Professional, Business and Executive members can initiate a conversation by sending a private message. Basic and Basic+ members cannot initiate conversations.</p>

			<table class="table table-bordered">
				<tr>
					<td>Basic</td>
					<td>Basic+</td>
					<td>Professional</td>
					<td>Business</td>
					<td>Executive</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>N/A</td>
					<td>N/A</td>
					<td>5 Bids</td>
					<td>4 Bids</td>
					<td>3 Bids</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p><b>Employer interest</b></p>

			<p>Regardless of membership level, any member that receives an invitation or is awarded a job can communicate with their employer regularly via private message.</p>
