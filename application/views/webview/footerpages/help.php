    Where do you go when you need help from a company? For instance a widget is broken or a site isn’t doing what you want it to, or you just need help with any number of things.  More often than not, your desire for information leads you to Google where you type in your query and you get a support center. A great support center is where your customers can go to find answers to commonly asked questions and if it’s done well it should be packed with useful information. If you set it up right and take the time to customize it, your support center can also be a seamless extension of your brand.

    As part of Desk.com’s Customer WOW team, I spend a lot of time with customers advising them on support strategy and helping them get their support center up and looking good.  We’ve seen the gamut of support sites, from bare bones to completely tricked out and we wanted to tip our hat to a few outstanding examples. These support centers not only provide excellent content, but they’ve also feature some clever design elements.
