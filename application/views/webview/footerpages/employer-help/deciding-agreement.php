<p>The agreement your freelancer sends you tells our system how to bill you. It also sets the scope and establishes a timeline. It's the key to beginning the job successfully.

<p>Ask your freelancer to send you an agreement after you've hired them. It should be the first thing you do before they begin work.</p>

<p><u>Three Agreement Types</u></p>

<p><b>"Fixed-Priced Agreement (completed milestones)"</b> Your freelancer sets up milestones. Each Milestone has a value and a due date.  You pay for a milestone once it's finished.</p>

"Hourly Agreement (weekly time tracked)" Your freelancer sets the max hours per week, hourly rate and a billing end date.  The system sends you an invoice every Monday based on the time your freelancer has tracked the prior week.</p>

<p><b>"Recurring Payments (cyclical billing)"</b> Your freelancer sets a price, billing cycle, and an end date.  They have the option to choose a weekly, biweekly, monthly or quarterly billing.  Invoices for weekly and biweekly will be generated on Monday.   Monthly and Quarterly agreements will be billed on the 1stof each month.</p>

<p><u>Choosing Auto-Payment Terms:</u></p>

<p><b>"Automatic SafePay Funding"</b> will require you to automatically fund the next milestone or the next week of work as defined in your freelancer's agreement. Turning this option on will bill you automatically using one or more of your verified payment methods and/or your cash account.</p></p>

<p>The hierarchy for automatic SafePay funding is: cash account, primary verified payment method, and any other verified payment method on file. The system will attempt to bill you in that order. It will bill one or more method partially if needed.</p>

<p><b>"Automatic Invoice Payments"</b> sets the timing for when an invoice is paid. If an invoice is sent by your freelancer and there are enough funds in SafePay then the system will automatically pay the invoice in 7, 14, or 28 daysâ€”it depends on what your freelancer selected when they set up the agreement. You can still pay the invoice sooner if they choose to. You can also delay automatic payment or dispute the invoice entirely to stop it from being paid.</p>

<p><u>Understanding Status Updates:</u></p>

<p>Based on your freelancer's selection, the system will remind them to update you if they haven't done so within the status update timeline they've chosen. Your freelancer can choose to provide status updates daily, every other day, weekly, every other week, or monthly.

<p><u>Understanding the "Scope of Work":</u></p>

<p>The scope of work can be added here. This should explain in as much detail as your freelancer likes the requirements of this job. Your freelancer can also attach images and documents.</p>

<p><u>Accepting and declining an agreement:</u></p>

<p>Once your freelancer sends their agreement you'll receive an email notification.</p>
    <ol class="help-list">
    <li>Log into the site.</li>
    <li>On the dashboard, find the job in question under the "Work Rooms" tile.</li>
    <li>Click the profile icon of your freelancer.</li>
    <li>Click the "Agreement" tab.</li>
    <li>Review the agreement.</li>
    <li>Accept or decline it.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Any changes your freelancer makes to the agreement have to be accepted by you. You'll receive a notification if they change the agreement.</p>

<p><u>Seeing previous versions of the agreement:</u></p>

    <ol class="help-list">
        <li>Log into the site.</li>
        <li>On the dashboard, find the job in question under the "Work Rooms" tile.</li>
        <li>Click the profile icon of your freelancer.</li>
        <li>Click the "Agreement" tab.</li>
        <li>Find the agreement accepted date at the top right.</li>
        <li>Click on the date.</li>
        <li>The previous agreements will drop down and allow you to view them.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Understanding the effective date of an agreement:</p>
    <ol class="help-list">
    <li>An agreement isn't effective unless you accept it and the effective date is today or a prior date.
    <li>If your freelancer edits an effective, fixed-price agreement:
        <ol class="help-list">
            <li>The original agreement is archived and no longer effective as soon as your freelancer sends the new agreement to you.</li>
            <li>The SafePay funds for which your freelancer has not yet invoiced will be refunded to your cash account.</li>
            <li>Once the new agreement is accepted and becomes effective, you will be prompted to add funds to comply with the new agreement.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    <li>If your freelancer edits an effective, hourly agreement:
        <ol class="help-list">
            <li>The original agreement remains in effect until the effective date of the newly accepted agreement.</li>
            <li>SafePay funds are not refunded to your cash account.</li>
            <li>On reaching the effective date of the new agreement, you will be prompted to fund SafePay per the new agreement.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
