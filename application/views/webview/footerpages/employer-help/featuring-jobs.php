			    <p>If you want your job to have more exposure and appear at the top of the search results you can have your job featured. Having your job featured costs $29.95 and lasts for 30 days.  If your job remains open longer, it will return to normal after 30 days.</p>

				<p>This option is only available when posting a job and can’t be added later.  If you want to add this feature to an existing job, you’ll have to post the listing again.</p>
