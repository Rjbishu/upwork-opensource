				<p>You and your freelancer have two transaction options in our mandatory billing & payment system—paying invoices alone and paying invoices via SafePay. SafePay provides more payment protection than invoicing alone.</p>

				<p>If you’ve never worked with a freelancer before, we strongly recommend using SafePay. If you decide not to use Safepay, negotiation and arbitration aren’t available in the event of a dispute because there aren’t any funds in our control. Negotiation and arbitration services are only an option when there are funds in SafePay.</p>
