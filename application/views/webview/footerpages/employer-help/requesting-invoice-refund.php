<p>All invoices paid on our site are final but your freelancer can still provide a refund on a paid invoice if they wish.  Communicate your request for a refund to your freelancer in the messages section of your workroom, or via your preferred method of communication.</p>

<p>If your freelancer does not respond to your request we can reach out to them for you, but only after 3 business day of a message being sent on the winjobs.com site.  This way we can make sure they’ve received it.  Although we can’t guarantee you’ll get a refund, we can try to get a response for you.</p>

<p><u>NOTE:</u> Providing a refund from a paid invoice is solely at the freelancer’s discretion.  If they decline the request for a refund, we would not be able to pursue the issue any further.  We only recommend making payment once work is complete and delivered to you.</p>
