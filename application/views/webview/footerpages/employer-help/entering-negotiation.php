				<p>Negotiation is only possible is there are funds in SafePay and one of two things happen:</p>

				<p>
					<ul class="help-list">
						<li>A freelancer disputes a SafePay refund request.</li>
						<li>You dispute a Milestone invoice.</li>
						<li>When in negotiation, communication will continue as normal via the dispute page.  It is up to the two parties to decide how to move forward or divide up the funds.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>Accessing the dispute page:</p>

				<p>
					<ol class="help-list">
						<li>Log into your account.</li>
						<li>Click the “Pay” tab at the top of the page.</li>
						<li>Find the invoice in dispute.</li>
						<li>Click on the invoice to view it.</li>
						<li>Click “View Dispute”.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>Ending a dispute by proposing a resolution:</p>

				<p>Your freelancer is the only one that can resolve a dispute since they disputed your refund request originally. However, you can convey to them a resolution via the dispute page. This is how they would propose the dispute:</p>

				<p>
					<ol class="help-list">
						<li>Click “View Dispute” next to the appropriate invoice in the “Invoices” section of the dashboard.</li>
						<li>Click “Resolve Dispute”.</li>
						<li>Choose the proposed resolution and click “Send to Employer”.</li>
					</ol>
