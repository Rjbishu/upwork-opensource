			<p>Time Tracker is software that your freelancer can use that automatically tracks their time. As long as they have the software open, Time Tracker will track their minute-by-minute time and take random screenshots of their screen. Any time recorded by Time Tracker, if it meets the terms established in the agreement sent by your freelancer, will show up in the “Status Updates” page of their respective overview page.
